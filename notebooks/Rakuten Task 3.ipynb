What we can do is we can cluster similar shops together using any type of clustering algorithm or feature similarity measures. And based on the customer logging data, we can recommend different shops that are similar to the shop(s) that a particular user has been visiting or buying from.\n",

    "Moving on to a more technical discussion. There are a multitude of ways in which we can represent different vendor profiles. We can use NLP-based algorithms such as word2vec or doc2vec to extract feature vectors from the text-based shop informations that are available. Or encoding categorical attributes such as what category of goods that a particular shop is selling\n",

But it serves to differentiate casual buyers and active buyers. On top of that, it opens up potential for more complex feature engineering by adding features such as Average Purchase Value etc."
